# Agoda — Network Requests Report

Generated by automated capture of network and Performance Resource Timing data for https://www.agoda.com (final landing URL: https://www.agoda.com/en-in/).

**Summary**
- **Total resource timing entries captured:** 203
- **Breakdown (count and total transfer bytes by initiator type):**
  - **img:** 46 requests — 6,607,149 bytes
  - **script:** 72 requests — 2,316,721 bytes
  - **link:** 18 requests — 1,444,949 bytes
  - **css:** 1 request — 895,215 bytes
  - **xmlhttprequest:** 35 requests — 53,652 bytes
  - **fetch:** 20 requests — 8,506 bytes
  - **iframe:** 9 requests — 5,176 bytes
  - **beacon:** 1 request — 0 bytes
  - **other:** 1 request — 1,604 bytes

Notes: many third-party analytics/ads scripts show transferSize=0 in the browser Performance API due to cross-origin timing restrictions; the network log still contains URLs and status codes.

**Observations & Recommended Fixes**
- Images are the largest contributors by total bytes; convert hero banners to WebP/AVIF, provide responsive srcsets, and lazy-load non-critical images.
- Audit and split large JS bundles; defer non-critical JS and enable tree-shaking.
- Inline critical CSS, compress assets (Brotli/Gzip), and use long cache TTLs for static assets.
- Audit third-party trackers, remove duplicates, and load non-essential tags asynchronously or via server-side proxy to reduce client impact.

**Limitations**
- Cross-origin third-party resources can report 0 sizes in the Performance API unless they set Timing-Allow-Origin; thus some transferSize values are 0 by design.

**Files created**
- `reports/agoda_resource_timing.json` — the full performance capture (resource entries, aggregates, and top list).
